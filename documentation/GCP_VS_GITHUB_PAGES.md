## 🎯 Default Dev Port Mappings

### When you run `npm run dev`:
- **Port 8888**: React Main Frontend
  - Index: `index.html` (root directory)
  - Best for: Main development work

### When you run static site:
- **Port 8000**: Static Site (recommended)
  - Index: `static-site/index.html`
  - Best for: Production preview

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Deploy to GitHub Pages First
```bash
bash deploy-to-github-pages.sh
# Choose option 2 (Static Site - recommended)
# Enter custom domain or skip
```

**Result:** Your site is live at:
- Default: https://joesuuf.github.io/pokemon-dev/
- Custom: https://your-domain.com

---

### Step 2: Deploy to GCP for Comparison
```bash
# Install gcloud CLI first (one-time)
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
exec -l $SHELL
gcloud init

# Deploy to GCP
bash deploy-to-gcp.sh
# Follow prompts:
# 1. Login to GCP
# 2. Select/create project
# 3. Choose frontend (Static recommended)
# 4. Choose method (Cloud Storage recommended)
# 5. Enter custom domain (optional)
```

**Result:** Your site is live on GCP:
- Storage: https://storage.googleapis.com/BUCKET/index.html
- Custom: https://your-gcp-domain.com

---

### Step 3: Compare Performance
```bash
bash compare-deployments.sh
# Enter both URLs when prompted
# Review results in comparison-results-* folder
```

## 🔑 API Key Handling

### Your Current Setup: GitHub Repo Secret

You mentioned having a GitHub repository secret. Here's how it works:

#### On GitHub Pages:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml (example)
env:
  VITE_POKEMON_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.POKEMON_API_KEY }}
```

#### On GCP Cloud Storage:
```bash
# API key is client-side (same as GitHub Pages)
# Injected during build or loaded from config
```

#### On GCP Cloud Run (Most Secure):
```bash
# Store in Secret Manager
echo -n "your-key" | gcloud secrets create pokemon-api-key --data-file=-

# Deploy with secret
gcloud run deploy SERVICE \
  --set-secrets="POKEMON_API_KEY=pokemon-api-key:latest"
```

## 🎯 Decision Matrix

### Choose GitHub Pages If:
- ✅ Cost is primary concern (free)
- ✅ Simple static site
- ✅ Open source project
- ✅ No monitoring needed
- ✅ GitHub Actions already used
- ✅ Traffic < 100K visits/month

### Choose GCP If:
- ✅ Need advanced monitoring/logging
- ✅ Require guaranteed SLA (99.95%)
- ✅ Enterprise requirements
- ✅ Custom infrastructure control
- ✅ Integration with other GCP services
- ✅ Need backend API proxy
- ✅ Budget allows $1-20/month

### Recommendation:
**For Pokemon TCG Search:** Start with **GitHub Pages** (free), add GCP later if monitoring/SLA needed.

## 🔄 Deployment Workflows

### GitHub Pages Workflow:
```
Code Change → Git Push → GitHub Actions → Build → Deploy → Live
Time: 2-3 minutes
Cost: $0
```

### GCP Cloud Storage Workflow:
```
Code Change → Local Build → Upload to Bucket → Live
Time: 1-2 minutes
Cost: ~$0.50/month
```

### GCP Cloud Run Workflow:
```
Code Change → Build Container → Deploy → Live
Time: 3-5 minutes
Cost: ~$10/month
```

---

## 📋 Commands Cheat Sheet

### Local Development:
```bash
# Start React (port 8888)
npm run dev

# Start static site (port 8000)
cd static-site && python3 -m http.server 8000

# Interactive dev server selector
bash start-local-dev.sh
```

### Deployment:
```bash
# Deploy to GitHub Pages
bash deploy-to-github-pages.sh

# Deploy to GCP
bash deploy-to-gcp.sh

# Compare both
bash compare-deployments.sh
```

### GCP Management:
```bash
# View deployments
gcloud storage buckets list          # Storage
gcloud run services list              # Cloud Run

# View logs
gcloud logging read --limit 50

# View costs
gcloud billing accounts list
```

### GitHub Pages:
```bash
# Check deployment status
# Visit: https://github.com/joesuuf/pokemon-dev/deployments

# View via gh CLI (if installed)
gh run list
gh run view [run-id]
```

---

## 🌍 Custom Domain Setup

### Cloudflare DNS (Works for Both)

#### For GitHub Pages:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: subdomain (or @)
Target: joesuuf.github.io
Proxy: DNS only (gray cloud) ← REQUIRED
```

#### For GCP Cloud Storage:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: subdomain
Target: c.storage.googleapis.com
Proxy: DNS only OR Proxied (both work!)
```

**Key Difference:** GCP allows orange cloud (proxied), GitHub Pages requires gray cloud (DNS only).

3. Add Cloudflare DNS for custom domain
4. Monitor with free tools (UptimeRobot, Google Analytics)

**Phase 2 - If Needed:**
1. Deploy to **GCP Cloud Storage** for comparison
2. Test performance for 1 week
3. Compare costs (should be ~$0.50/month)
4. Decide based on actual needs

**Phase 3 - Scale Up (Optional):**
1. Move to **GCP Cloud Run** if backend needed
